{"name":"Kppy","tagline":"A Python-module to provide an API to KeePass 1.x files commonly used by KeePassX.","body":"kppy v.1.3.2\r\n============\r\n\r\nA Python 3-module to provide an API to KeePass v1.x password database files which are also used by\r\nthe popular KeePassX.\r\n\r\n* License: GPL v3 or later\r\n* Author: Karsten-Kai König <kkoenig@posteo.de>\r\n* Stable download: https://github.com/raymontag/kppy/tarball/master\r\n* Bug tracker: https://github.com/raymontag/kppy/issues?state=open\r\n* Git: git://github.com/raymontag/kppy.git\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n---------\r\n\r\n* Full Access to KeePass v1.x/KeePassX files:\r\n** Open, save and close KP-files correctly\r\n** Edit KP-files correctly and comfortable\r\n** AES encryption\r\n** First Python module for KeePass 1.x files that supports keyfiles, too.\r\n** First Python-KeePass module for Python 3.\r\n\r\n* Some explanation to KeePass databases:\r\n** Database files are encrypted with AES\r\n** Database entries are sorted in groups\r\n** Groups support subgroups\r\n** Every entry has a title for better identification\r\n** Expiration dates for entries\r\n\r\nDependencies:\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n* Python 3.x\r\n* PyCrypto's py3k branch (https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto/tarball/py3k)\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\n--------\r\n\r\nJust type \"python setup.py install\" (or \"python3 setup.py install\") with root\r\nrights in the root directory of kppy.\r\n\r\nWARNING:\r\n--------\r\n\r\nAs long as the database is opened with this\r\nmodule, the password is saved as plain text in RAM. Even if\r\nthe database was closed correctly it is possible that the password lies\r\nsomewhere in your computer's RAM, it's not possible to prevent this in Python.\r\nThat is, if your computer is compromised it is possible to dump the password\r\nfrom memory. To prevent some scenarios you could change the working directory of Python to /var/empty on UNIX-like systems while using kppy. Are core dump wouldn't be possible unless you're using kppy as root.\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2012-2013 Karsten-Kai König <kkoenig@posteo.de>\r\n\r\nkppy is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms\r\nof the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation,\r\neither version 3 of the License, or at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nkppy is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY\r\nWARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR\r\nA PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
